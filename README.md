# ch9searchingBenchmarks

Create a project that has an array with 100 integer elements. Fill the elements of that array with the value of the subscripts, so element 0 has value 0, element 1 has value 1, and so on. Write a function that does a linear search on the array to find a value and returns the number of comparisons it made to find that value. Write a second function that does a binary search on the same array looking for the same value, and returns the number of comparisons it makes. In the main function, call both search functions 3 times: for a number in the middle of the array, such as 49; for a number at the beginning of the array, such as 3; and for a number at the end of the array, such as 99.

Here is an example of the result:

![Ch 9 Search Benchmarks](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch9searchingBenchmarks/blob/main/ch9searchingBenchmarks/searching.PNG)

Run the project using the values shown in the image, to validate that your code is working as it should.

Run the project with different values that shown in the image; make sure you use a value in the middle of the array, one near the right end of the array, and one near the left end of the array. Take a screenshot of the results.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
